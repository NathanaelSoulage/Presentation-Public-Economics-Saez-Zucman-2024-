This repository is dedicated to my presentation "Distributional Tax Analysis in Theory and Practice: Harberger Meets Diamond-Mirrlees" (Saez and Zucman, 2024), with Alexandra Anghel 

In Public Economics class (taught by Prof. Stefan Pollinger) we made a one-hour presentation of this very recent article by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. 
The authors present issues associated with usual distributional tax analysis and propose a brand new framework, to analyse current-tax and tax reform distributional implications.
